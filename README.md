## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Install dependencies**


    ```shell
    npm i
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

3.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your version of the wall-deco site is now running at http://localhost:8000! To view the graphql layer go to http://localhost:8000/___graphql

    Look at gatsby config to note dependencies. You will need to set up a Sanity backend, and get credentials for the Shopify connection as well. Happy coding.
